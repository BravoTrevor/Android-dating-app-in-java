Dating App for the young Kenyan adult


Description
KanairoRizz is a "dating" app specifically tailored for young adults in Kenyan campuses. This is to take advantage of the lack of existing dating apps that focus on the local dating scene. Most apps are build by and for Western-country users whose dating ideals and norms are quite different from those of Kenyans.  


App’s structure model

1.	User Registration:
●	Users create an account by providing basic information like name, age, gender, and location. This will be part of profile creation
●	Optional additional information can be added to personalize profiles, such as hobbies, interests, and a bio.
●	There is an option to use a “Smart Photos” feature, which helps the user decide on the best photos. The user is prompted to upload a couple of his/her photos, then the “Smart Photos” feature evaluates the pictures on their behalf and selects the best to appear first. 
2.	User Profiles:
●	Users can view and edit their profiles, including uploading pictures and writing a bio.
●	Include options to link social media profiles (e.g., Instagram) to showcase more about themselves.
3.	Geolocation and Discovery:
●	Implement geolocation to match users with potential matches in their vicinity.
●	Users can set their preferred search radius and age range for better matches.
●	Include a swipe feature (similar to Tinder) to like or dislike profiles based on user preferences.
●	Implement a matching algorithm to suggest potential matches based on user preferences, interests, and location.
4.	Messaging and Communication:
●	Users can send messages and engage in private conversations with their matches.
●	Include features like text messaging, photo sharing, and the ability to send voice or video messages.
5.	User Verification and Safety:
●	Implement a user verification process to ensure genuine profiles and enhance safety.
●	Allow users to report or block other users for inappropriate behaviour.
●	Include privacy settings for users to control their visibility and who can contact them.
6.	Additional Features:
●	Include a "Discover" or "Explore" section to showcase profiles beyond the user's preferences, allowing for more serendipitous connections.
●	Implement a "Moments" feature (similar to Snapchat or Instagram Stories) for users to share temporary photos or updates with their matches. These photos will be deleted after a certain duration of time, like 24 hours.
●	Offer different tier levels like a premium subscription with additional features like unlimited swipes, enhanced search filters, and ad-free experience.
7.	Community and Events:
●	Create a community aspect where users can join groups, participate in discussions, and share experiences.
●	Organize local events or meetups to facilitate in-person connections. This can utilize ongoing events like the Safari Rally Kenya 2023 which is scheduled to be held from 22 June to 25 June 2023 in Naivasha.
8.	Feedback and Reporting:
●	Provide a feedback mechanism for users to suggest improvements or report issues.
●	Regularly update the app with bug fixes, new features, and enhancements based on user feedback.
